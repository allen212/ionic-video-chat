# Ionic PWA Toolkit

The Ionic PWA Toolkit is the recommended way to build production ready PWAs with Ionic. This toolkit gets you started with using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), Ionic Core and Ionic PWA hosting. This combination of tools gives you the ability to build a fast, efficient PWA with zero config needed and all the best practices built in out of the box.

## What does this include

- Stencil
- Ionic
- Push Notifications setup
- Showing a toast when a new version of the PWA is available
- Unit Tests
- Pre-rendering
- zero config lazy loading
- zero config code splitting
- Polyfills selectively loaded depending on the browser support
- ES6 by default for new browsers, ES5 for older browsers
- Everything needed for an add to homescreen PWA (service worker, web manifest and iOS meta tags)
- lazy-img component for lazy loading below the fold images

## Getting Started

To start building a PWA with the Ionic PWA Toolkit, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-pwa-toolkit.git my-pwa
cd my-pwa
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Production

To build your PWA for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
A production build includes everything needed for your project to be a PWA right out of the box. This includes both a Web Manifest (src/manifest.json) and a Service Worker (www/sw.js).


## Service Workers

For info on how Service Workers work in Stencil check out our [Service Worker docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/service-workers).

## Developing with a Service Worker

In some cases, for instance when you are working on adding [web push notifications](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/) or [background sync](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync), both which require a Service Worker, it can be handy to be able to dev builds with a service worker.

To do this with the Ionic PWA toolkit simply run `npm run devWithSW`. This will start a dev build, but with the Service Worker also getting livereloaded.


## Unit Tests

To run the unit tests once, run:

```
npm test
```

To run the unit tests and watch for file changes during development, run:

```
npm run test.watch
```

## Testing your PWA's performance

We recommend using https://www.webpagetest.org/easy with the `Run Lighthouse Audit` option turned on. This will give you an in depth look into your PWAs load performance on the average device connected to the average network.
